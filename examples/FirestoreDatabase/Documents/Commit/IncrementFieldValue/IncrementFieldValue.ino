/**
 * APP INITIALIZATION
 * ==================
 *
 * This library provides the APIs covers the different types of authentication and services.
 *
 * The FirebaseApp class was introduced as user authentication provider which provides the credentials data
 * used for accessing the Firebase services.
 *
 * The Database, Firestore, Functions, Messaging, Storage and Cloud Storage apps provided the functions based on
 * the specific Firebase services which take the auth credentials data from FirebaseApp.
 *
 * Multiples instances of FirebaseApp (auth provider) and services apps (Database, Firestore...) can be available
 * which depends on the device memory.
 *
 * The FirebaseApp should be initialized first before use via static function initializeApp.
 *
 * SYNTAXES:
 *
 * initializeApp(<AsyncClient>, <FirebaseApp>, <user_auth_data>);
 *
 * The AsyncClient stores the user, server and network data which can be initialized as.
 *
 * WiFiClientSecure ssl_client;
 * DefaultNetwork network;
 * AsyncClient aClient(ssl_client, getNetwork(network));
 *
 * The FirebaseApp manage and stores the authentication data;
 *
 * The user_auth_data store the user credentials which can be obtained from one of following Auth classes.
 * UserAuth, ServiceAuth, CustomAuth, IDToken, AccessToken, CustomToken, LegacyToken and NoAuth via static function getAuth.
 *
 * Please see examples/App/AppInitialization for usage guidelines.
 *
 * To use other network interfaces, network data from one of the following Network classes
 * can be assigned.
 *
 * DefaultNetwork, GenericNetwork, EthernetNetwork and GSMNetwork.
 *
 * The network data (network_config_data) can be obtained from these Network classes via static function getNetwork.
 *
 * Please see examples/App/NetworkInterfaces for the usage guidelines.
 *
 * The auth credential data can be set to Services App e.g. Database to initialize via function getApp.
 *
 * SYNTAX:
 *
 * app.getApp<T>(<services_app>);
 *
 * Deallocation of FirebaseApp causes these services apps uninitialized and cannot be used.

/**
 * COMMIT DOCUMENTS FUNCTIONS
 * ==========================
 *
 * SYNTAXES:
 *
 * Docs.commit(<AsyncClient>, <Firestore::Parent>, <Writes>);
 * Docs.commit(<AsyncClient>, <Firestore::Parent>, <Writes>, <AsyncResult>);
 * Docs.commit(<AsyncClient>, <Firestore::Parent>, <Writes>, <AsyncResultCallback>, <uid>);
 *
 * The <Firestore::Parent> is the Firestore::Parent object included project Id and database Id in its constructor.
 * The Firebase project Id should be only the name without the firebaseio.com.
 * The Firestore database id should be (default) or empty "".
 *
 * The <Writes> is the writes to apply.
 *
 * The async functions required AsyncResult or AsyncResultCallback function that keeping the result.
 *
 * The uid is user specified UID of async result (optional) which used as async task identifier.
 *
 * The uid can later get from AsyncResult object of AsyncResultCallback function via aResult.uid().
 */

/**
 * The AsyncResult object in the AsyncResultCallback function provides the result of async and non-async operations.
 *
 * APP EVENT
 * =========
 *
 * The event information can be obtained from aResult.appEvent().code() and aResult.appEvent().message() respectively.
 *
 * The following event code (firebase_auth_event_type), auth_event_uninitialized, auth_event_initializing, auth_event_signup, auth_event_send_verify_email,
 * auth_event_delete_user, auth_event_reset_password, auth_event_token_signing, auth_event_authenticating, auth_event_auth_request_sent
 * auth_event_auth_response_received, auth_event_ready and auth_event_error are available.
 *
 *
 * The following event strings "undefined", "initializing", "sign up", "send verification email", "delete user", "reset password",
 * "token signing", "authenticating", "auth request sent", "auth response received", "ready" and "error" are available.
 *
 * RESULT DATA
 * ===========
 *
 * The result data can be obtained from AsyncResult object via aResult.payload(), aResult.available(), aResult.path(), aResult.etag()
 * aResult.database.isStream(), aResult.database.event(), aResult.database.dataPath(), aResult.database.type() and result.database.name().
 *
 * The function aResult.payload() returns server serponse payload.
 *
 * The function aResult.available() returns the size of data that is ready to read.
 *
 * The function aResult.path() returns the resource path that the request was sent.
 *
 * The function aResult.etag() returns the ETag from server response header.
 *
 * The function aResult.database.name() returns the name (random UID) of node that will be creaated after calling push.
 *
 * The function aResult.database.type() returns the following database data type enum.
 * database_data_type_undefined (-1), database_data_type_null (0), database_data_type_integer(1), database_data_type_float (2),
 * database_data_type_double (3), database_data_type_boolean (4), database_data_type_string (5), database_data_type_json (6),
 * and database_data_type_array (7).
 *
 * The aResult.database.dataPath() and aResult.database.event() are the database node path that data has changed and type of event in server-sent events (stream) mode.
 *
 * The server response payload in AsyncResult can be converted to the the values e.g. boolean, integer,
 * float, double and string via aResult.database.to<T>() or result.database.to<T>().
 *
 * ASYNC QUEUE
 * ===========
 *
 * Each sync and async requests data consume memory up to 1k. When many async operations are added to queue (FIFO), the memory usage was increased.
 *
 * Each AsyncClient handles this queue separately. Then in order to limit the memory used for each AsyncClient,
 * this library allows 3-5 async operations (called slots) can be stored in the queue at the same time.
 *
 * If the authentication async operation was required, it will insert to the first slot of the queue.
 *
 * If the sync operation was called, it will insert to the first slot in the queue too but after the authentication task slot.
 *
 * When async Get operation in SSE mode (HTTP Streaming) was currently stored in queue, the new sync and async operations will be inserted before
 * the async SSE (HTTP Streaming) slot.
 *
 * When the async operation queue is full, the new sync and async operations will be cancelled.
 *
 * The finished and time out operating slot will be removed from the queue unless the async SSE and allow the vacant slot for the new async operation.
 *
 * The async SSE operation will run continuously and repeatedly as long as the FirebaseApp and the services app
 * (Database, Firestore, Messaging, Functions, Storage and CloudStorage) objects was run in the loop via app.loop() or database.loop().
 *
 * STOP QUEUE
 * ===========
 *
 * SYNTAX:
 *
 * The async operation will be cancelled and remove from the queue by calling thes functions.
 *
 * asyncClient.stopAsync() - stop the last async operation in the queue.
 *
 * asyncClient.stopAsync(true) - stop all async operation in the queue.
 *
 * asyncClient.stopAsync("xxxx") - stop the async operation in the queue that has the async result UID xxxx.
 *
 * ASYNC CLIENT
 * ============
 *
 * The async client stores the async operating data in its queue and holds the pointer of SSL Client that assigned with it.
 *
 * The SSL Client should be existed in the AsyncClient usage scope in case of sync or should defined as global object for async usage.
 *
 * The SSL Client should not be shared among various AsyncClients because of interferences in async operations.
 *
 * Only one SSL Client should be assigned to or used with only one AsyncClient.
 *
 * SSL Client can force to stop by user or calling stop() from asyncClient.
 *
 * SYNTAX:
 *
 * asyncClient.stop() - stop the SSL Client to terminate the server connection.
 *
 *
 * THE STATIC ASYNC RESULT REQUIRED FOR ASYNC OPERATION
 * ====================================================
 *
 * Library provided the class object called AsyncResult that keeps the server response data, debug and error information.
 *
 * There are two sources of async result in this library:
 *
 * 1. From user provided with async application (function).
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * `Database.get(aClient, "/test/int", options, aResult);`
 *
 * 2. From dynamic allocation in the async client.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * `Database.get(aClient, "/test/int", options, asyncCB);`
 *
 * From source 1, the async result (`aResult`) shall be defined globally to use in async application because of the static data is needed for use while running the sync task.
 *
 * From source 2, the async client (`aClient`) shall be defined globally to use in async application too to make sure the instance of async result was existed or valid while running the sync task.
 *
 * If async result was destroyed (destructed or not existed) before it was used by async task handler, the danglig pointer problem will be occurred.
 *
 * Note that, the async client object used in authentication task shoul be defined globally as it is async task.
